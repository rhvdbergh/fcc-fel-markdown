  "# Markdown Previewer\n\n## This is how it works:\n\nEdit the text in the box on the left (or on top on smaller screens) in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to produce an HTML output preview on the right (or bottom on smaller screens).\n\nYou can use backticks to mark up `inline code`.\n\nYou can also mark up whole blocks of code by adding three backticks to any code block:\n```\nfunction makeEmSmile(withReact) {\n    console.log('Smile!');'\n}\n```\n\nIt's as easy as one, two, three to create lists:\n\n1. Cheese \n2. Milk\n\nYou can make block quotes by using the greater than sign:\n\n> This is a placeholder for an awesome quote!\n\nYou can even show people photographs, like this random photograph, courtesy of [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) <-- and that's how you insert links, by the way:\n\n![Placeholder image](https://picsum.photos/640/480/)\n\nI should probably also show you how to **bold text** or _italicize_ text.\n\nThis markdown previewer was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) project. It uses [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) as a markdown parser and compiler.\n\nIf you want to see more of my work, connect with me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ronaldvdb), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronaldvanderbergh), [GitHub](https://github.com/rhvdbergh), or my blog at [https://vanderbergh.com](https://vanderbergh.com).";
